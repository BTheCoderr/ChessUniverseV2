# Chess Universe - The Ultimate Chess Evolution

Chess Universe isn't just another chess appâ€”it's a complete chess evolution. Starting with traditional chess (Black moves first), players progress through unique level-based challenges, unlocking new queen abilities and competing for massive bets and high-stakes tournaments.

## Features

### Progressive Chess Experience
- **Level 1 - Traditional Chess (Black Moves First)**: Regular chess rules with Black moving first.
- **Level 2 - Queen's First Transformation**: Queens lose their Rook-like vertical/horizontal moves, but can move like a Bishop, King, and Horse.
- **Level 3 - Queen's Second Transformation**: Queens lose their Bishop-like diagonal movement, but can move like a Rook, King, and Horse.
- **Level 4 - The Ultimate Evolution**: Queens regain all normal chess abilities and also move like a Horse (Knight).

### Magic Horse Challenge
- Special mini-game that unlocks new levels
- Board Setup: Three rows filled with 24 Queens and a single Horse (Knight)
- Objective: Move the Horse to land on and remove Queens
- Cannot land on an empty square
- Must leave only a specific number of Queens to win (4, 2, or 1 depending on the challenge level)

### Battle Chess Mode
- All pieces are pushed to the center of the board (face-to-face)
- Black still goes first
- Players can choose to play any unlocked level in this new formation

### Custom Chess Setup
